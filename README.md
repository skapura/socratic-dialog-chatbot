# Ethos Chat Bot

Research project for a RAG-based multi-agent chatbot system.

Multiple chatbots using different external data sources.  Each data source is a different collection of
dialictic texts from (primarily) ancient Greek philosophy.  These texts were selected because they are
presented in the form of a dialog, which is ideal for a chatbot format.
